# Research

This repository keeps track of my current research reading list mostly relating to cryptoeconomics, blockchains, cryptography and distributed systems as well as my notes. The notes are written with my own personal use in mind, but hopefully they can serve as a short, high-level overview of some of the concepts and readers can find the actual technical details by diving into the readings.

Feel free to suggest interesting things to read by opening an issue or commenting on one of the existing issues!

Inspired by Nicola Greco's [decentralized research repository](https://github.com/nicola/decentralized-research) which contains a great list of readings related to decentralization.
